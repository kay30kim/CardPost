## CardPost

#### Explaination:
CardPost is a React-based bulletin board for managing author and context content. It facilitates the upload and retrieval of data on the website, utilizing React, Redux, JavaScript, and CSS to build a comprehensive full-stack app. This project is designed to be a valuable resource for those learning React, providing tutorials on advanced topics, real-world application development, and performance optimization techniques.

## Project Status
The project is currently in development, allowing users to filter tweets by username and keyword with visual data representation. Ongoing work includes implementing functionality to sort by additional parameter needing to add few thing related to back-end.

#### Example:

## Reflection
  The project aimed to apply technologies learned and explore new features through documentation. Initially envisioned as a Twitter API data-pulling application for user interests, it began with the create-react-app boilerplate, later integrating react-router-4.0 and redux. Authentication emerged as a significant challenge, leading to research on OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication. Due to time constraints, authentication was deferred, and focus shifted to visualizing data from API parts unrestricted to authenticated users.

  Implemented technologies include React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, LoDash, D3, along with substantial use of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. The create-react-app boilerplate minimized setup time, allowing deeper exploration of technological aspects. Future iterations plan to handroll a webpack.config.js file for a more in-depth understanding of the build process.
